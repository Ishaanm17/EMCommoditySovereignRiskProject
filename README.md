Project File name: ["  EM Commodity Prices Sovereign, Country, and Political Risk Project-NYU Data Bootcamp]

Project Description

This project will explore the relationship between commodity prices and Emerging Markets' GDP Output. Variables that will be explored includes Financial, Economic, and Political Risk from ICRG(International Country Risk Guide),Commodity Prices, and Export and Imports of commodities. After initial data importing and graphing, correleations will be shown to demonstrate the strong effect financial risk, political risk, and country risk (combination of political and economic risk), imports of commodities by Industrialized Countries and exports of Commodities by Emerging Markets have on Commoidity Prices, which in turn effect the output of Emerging Markets GDP. To outweigh both China and BRICS's aggregrate effect on the overall EM GDP output in this project, multiple regression analyses were done in order to present a more accurate analysis. Finally, Machine Learning will be used to project the likelihood of a risk variable making a high impact on EM's GDP Output.
